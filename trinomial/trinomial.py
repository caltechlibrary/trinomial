    '''Take "text" and transform it to a short string of hexadecimal digits.

    The transformation is based on hashing the original string in combination
    with a unique key derived from the computer on which Trinomial is used.
    To the degree possible, the transformation is consistent, such that the
    same input will always yield the same output.  This is guaranteed to be
    the case within a single run of the program calling this function; it
    should also be true from run to run as well, but on some systems, the
    unique key may change after a reboot, and this will change the output for
    a given input.  Virtual machines and cloud-provisioned systems, in
    particular, may suffer from this limitation.

    The unique key can be set explicitly using set_unique_key(...).

    The possibility of output collisions between two or more identical input
    values is low, but not zero.  The calculation of collisions for a hash
    function is based on the number of bits b in the hashed output value,
    according to the function 2^(b/2).  A hexadecimal character can encode 4
    bits, which means a hexadecimal string of length n is equal to n * 4 bits.
    This means that the Trinomial default length of 10 output characters
    gives a maximum of 2^(4*10/2) = 1,048,576 possible unique values.  In the
    author's opinion, this is reasonable for a situation such as (e.g.)
    anonymizing email addresses in the logs of a program at a small
    educational institution, but may be too low for other situations. Users
    may want to increase the `length` parameter to `anon` accordingly.

    # collisions compared to the unmodified Blake2b hash.  That actually
    # increases security for our purpose of obscuring the original value, but
    # also increases the risk of collisions compared to Blake2b.  However,
    # collision risk is measured in terms of bits in the final hash string,
    # according to 2^(n/2), where n is the number of bits.  A length of 10
    # hex digits is 40 bits => 2^(40/2) = 2^20 = 1,048,576 unique values.

    generate a different output on different computers).  This is intended for
    testing and debugging.  Do not do this in production code.  Setting the
